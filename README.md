# SurgiAR: Augmented Reality for Surgical Training

##
"SurgiAR" is an augmented reality application to improve surgical instrument handling skills for medical trainees. Developed using Python, it incorporates Computer Vision and YOLOv5 object detection to provide a dynamic training experience. The application includes a Tkinter-based user interface and integrates YOLOv5 with OpenCV for accurate tool tracking, showcasing a practical blend of problem-solving, machine learning, and software design. 

## Motivation
The project was developed to offer a safer alternative for surgical training, allowing trainees to practice instrument handling without the risks associated with live patient operations.

## Instruments
The instruments used for the training are:
- Micro-scissors, and 
- Micro-forceps. 

## Training Tasks
The main training task available in the application is the Path tracking task.
It allows the user to move an object along a path on the computer screen using specific surgical instruments.

## Software Tools
- Python
- YOLOv5
- Tkinter
- LabelImg
