# Augmented Reality for Surgical Handling Skills Training

##

The main goal of this application is to implement methods that would combine AR technology with surgical skills training. 

The Augmented Reality Surgical skills training application is designed to be used at Coglab by people from the medical domain who need to improve their skills 
in the use and handling of microsurgical instruments such as the micro-scissors. 
The application is equipped with a single, pre-designed task which the user chooses and starts training immediately using the surgical instruments it was designed with. 

## Instruments
The instruments used for the training are:
- Micro-scissors, and 
- Micro-forceps. 

## Training Tasks
The main training task available in the application is the Path tracking task.
It allows the user to move an object along a path on the computer screen using any of the available surgical instruments.

## Software Tools
- Python
- YOLOv5
- Tkinter
- LabelImg
